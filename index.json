This manner of social navigation is challenging given the constraints of human comfort and social rules. Traditional methods based on hand-craft cost functions to achieve this task have difficulties to operate in the complex real world. Other learning-based approaches fail to address the naturalness aspect from the perspective of collective formation behaviors. We present an autonomous navigation system capa- ble of operating in dense crowds and utilizing information of social groups. The underlying system incorporates a deep neural network to track social groups and join the flow of a social group in facilitating the navigation. A collision avoidance layer in the system further ensures navigation safety. In experiments, our method generates socially compliant behaviors as state-of- the-art methods. More importantly, the system is capable of navigating safely in a densely populated area (10+ people in a 10 m Ã— 20 m area) following crowd flows to reach the goal.","tags":["Robotics"],"title":"Following Social Groups: Socially Compliant Autonomous Navigation in Dense Crowds","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1566864000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1578078215,"objectID":"e234df742eeefb7fc0102e1489562433","permalink":"https://xyaoab.github.io/project/social-navigation/","publishdate":"2019-08-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/social-navigation/","section":"project","summary":"Socially Compliant Autonomous Navigation in Dense Crowds","tags":["Robotics"],"title":"Social navigation","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1510108655,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1510108655,"objectID":"aa574e63f208e482bff8578cd0470489","permalink":"https://xyaoab.github.io/project/smart-home-hub/","publishdate":"2017-11-07T23:37:35-03:00","relpermalink":"/project/smart-home-hub/","section":"project","summary":"2017 Fall ELEC3300 course project","tags":["Robotics"],"title":"Smart Home Hub","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1488765117,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1488765117,"objectID":"00e7f4cf6103ee93d1b6ccefac5a4647","permalink":"https://xyaoab.github.io/project/robot-guide/","publishdate":"2017-03-06T02:51:57+01:00","relpermalink":"/project/robot-guide/","section":"project","summary":"WiFi signal strength-based robot indoor localization","tags":["Robotics"],"title":"Robot Tour Guide","type":"project"}]

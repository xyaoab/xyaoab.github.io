This manner of social navigation is challenging given the constraints of human comfort and social rules. Traditional methods based on hand-craft cost functions to achieve this task have difficulties to operate in the complex real world. Other learning-based approaches fail to address the naturalness aspect from the perspective of collective formation behaviors. We present an autonomous navigation system capa- ble of operating in dense crowds and utilizing information of social groups. The underlying system incorporates a deep neural network to track social groups and join the flow of a social group in facilitating the navigation. A collision avoidance layer in the system further ensures navigation safety. In experiments, our method generates socially compliant behaviors as state-of- the-art methods. More importantly, the system is capable of navigating safely in a densely populated area (10+ people in a 10 m × 20 m area) following crowd flows to reach the goal.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Social navigation","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1566864000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1566864000,"objectID":"f0977fdbaf9d88417452a337ea319a18","permalink":"https://xyaoab.github.io/projects/social-navigation/","publishdate":"2019-08-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/projects/social-navigation/","section":"projects","summary":"Following Social Groups -- Socially Compliant Autonomous Navigation in Dense Crowds.","tags":["Robots"],"title":"Social navigation","type":"projects"}]
